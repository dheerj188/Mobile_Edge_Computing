# DRL based resource allocation and service migration in vehicular edge networks

Our final year project (capstone) was based out of finding optimal strategies to allocate resources for vehicular users at the edge of the network. 

Our Capstone project was divided into 2 phases 

1) Phase 1: Literature survey on edge and vehicular edge computing and deep reinforcement learning.
2) Phase 2: Implementation of a Novel resource allocation and service migration scheme to maintain QoS among users.

This work outperforms SOTA wrt to mean service violations.
