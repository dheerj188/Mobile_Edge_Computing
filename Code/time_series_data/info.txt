# Time series data was generated by running a base simulation
(time_series_gen.jl) and collecting
data, then adding noise using LHS to base data (time_series_gen/gen_series.py).

# Rules for naming convention of time series files.

Time series are stored as json files. Each of the files are named as base_series_injectionrate_alloccnt
